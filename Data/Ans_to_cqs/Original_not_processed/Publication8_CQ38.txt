 The bias in the data is addressed by acknowledging the inherent biases in the study and the
datasets used. The training and test datasets from MNHN Paris Herbarium are from the same
collection, while the Herbarium Senckenbergianum specimens are from an independent collection with
different geographical and taxonomic focus, but still with a number of higher taxa in common with
MNHN Paris Herbarium. The different datasets overlap mainly on the family level, partly on genus
level and only slightly between the MNHN Paris Herbarium training and test datasets at species
level. Therefore, it can be excluded that organ recognition is based upon species-specific features.
As in nature itself and the collections represented here, families are not represented equally.
Likewise, the number of labelled organs, represented in the dataset, is far from balanced and biased
both by the natural distribution of these organs in the sampled taxa and by the selection of
material by the collectors. Roots, for example, are mainly represented in Asteraceae and
Orchidaceae, and the number of labelled organs is biased towards leaves and stems. The model was
trained again on all the annotated scans and tested on a different un-annotated dataset. The model
performed well, based on visual inspection. In order to evaluate the performance of the model with
an average precision metric, around 200 of these scans were annotated by hand, based on the
predicted bounding boxes. The predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate
these scans, since the predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate. After being annotated,
these scans were compared with the predictions to evaluate the precision of the organ detection
model on this dataset.
