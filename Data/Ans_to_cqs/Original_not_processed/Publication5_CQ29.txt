 The data is not directly labeled or annotated in the provided context. However, the data is used to
train and test models for estimating plant species richness. The models are evaluated based on their
ability to predict species richness in independent datasets. The data is also used to identify which
variables at which time periods are more important for estimating plant species richness.
