 To explain model predictions, a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) is performed. In this
test, a single feature is randomly shuffled, while all the other features are kept constant. The
feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance decreases with random shuffling.
In this study, the root mean square error (RMSE) is used as the performance metric.
