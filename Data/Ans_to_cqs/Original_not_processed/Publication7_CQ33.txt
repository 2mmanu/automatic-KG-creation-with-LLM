  Yes, there are post-processing steps applied to the model's output. The classiﬁer's output is
post-processed to generate coral maps for the Abrolhos Islands. The coral maps are generated by
applying a threshold on the classiﬁer's output. The threshold is determined based on the classiﬁer's
performance on the Benthoz15 dataset. The coral maps are then used to quantify the coral population
automatically.
