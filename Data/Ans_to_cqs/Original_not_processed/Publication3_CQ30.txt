  In the model, the annotations or labels are used to train the model to recognize and classify the
different species of frogs. Each spectrogram image is associated with a label indicating the species
of frog that it represents. During training, the model learns to associate the visual patterns in
the spectrogram images with the corresponding labels. Once the model is trained, it can be used to
predict the species of frog for new, unlabeled spectrogram images.
