 The provided context does not contain information about the specific hyperparameters used in the
model. However, it is mentioned that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward
neural networks (DNNs) are used. Common hyperparameters for these types of models include the
learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of units in each layer, and regularization
parameters. The specific values of these hyperparameters would depend on the specific dataset and
problem being addressed.
