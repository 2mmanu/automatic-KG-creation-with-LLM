 The deep learning model in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture called
Faster R-CNN. It is a two-stage, region-based CNN detector that consists of three modules: 1) a deep
CNN image feature extraction network based on the ResNet-50 architecture, 2) a Region Proposal
Network (RPN) used for detection of a predefined number of Regions of Interests (RoIs) where the
object(s) of interest could reside within the image, and 3) Fast R-CNN, which computes a
classification score along with class-specific bounding box regression for each of these regions.
The RPN creates thousands of prior or anchor boxes to estimate the location of objects in the image,
and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is used to reduce the number of proposals.
