 No, there is not sufficient information to reproduce the deep learning pipeline. The paper does not
provide enough details about the deep learning pipeline, such as the architecture of the neural
network, the training procedure, and the evaluation metrics used. Additionally, the code and data
used in the study are not publicly available.
