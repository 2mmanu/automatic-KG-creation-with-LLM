 The passage does not provide specific details about the hardware and software used for model
deployment. However, it does mention that the data is stored at a co-located data center using off-
the-shelf computers, and managed and served with freely available software including Spark. Third-
party data centers such as those of Amazon Web Services (AWS) are increasingly becoming an option
for data storage. Additionally, machine learning (ML) techniques, such as deep learning (DL), are
used to progressively train computational models to detect and classify events of interest, and
reduce the amount of wildlife data reviewed by human analysts by orders of magnitude. However, the
passage does not specify the hardware and software used for model deployment.
