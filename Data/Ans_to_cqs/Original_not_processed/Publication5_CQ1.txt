 The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include multitemporal remote sensing data, such
as MODIS-derived NDVI and LAI images collected in 2009, and plant species richness data from South
Korea. The remote sensing data are co-registered and resampled to 30-arcseconds from 15-arcseconds
of the original sources. The plant species richness data from South Korea are used to estimate
potential plant species richness patterns for North Korea using a state-of-the-art DL approach.
