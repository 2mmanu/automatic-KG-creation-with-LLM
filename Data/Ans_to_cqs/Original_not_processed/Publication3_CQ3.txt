 The raw data was collected from two sources: (1) a large collection of Philippine frog
advertisement calls collected, archived, and made publicly available via Cornell Universityâ€™s
Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds, and (2) recent collections of
numerous undescribed species to augment sample sizes of previously described species and add
distinctive new candidate species identified with genetic and phenotypic characters. The majority of
species were characterized as unconfirmed but likely to eventually be recognized as new species, if
they are demonstrably diagnosable via at least three out of four independent data streams: discrete
phenotypic differences, discrete spectral or structural bioacoustic traits, genetically divergent
monophyletic haplotype clades, and allopatry on different Philippine Pleistocene Aggregate Island
Complexes. The behavioral context of calls and qualitative descriptions of calls were available in
original descriptions. Additional collection-associated natural history information, frog
microhabitats, community composition, recording methodology, and metadata were available via the
Macaulay Library portal and the KU Herpetology online Specify database, as well as via GBIF,
iDigBio, and other aggregators.
