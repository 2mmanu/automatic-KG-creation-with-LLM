 The preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model include the following:  1.
Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or noisy data points that may negatively impact
the model's performance. 2. Data normalization: This involves scaling the data to a common range to
ensure that all features are given equal importance during training. 3. Data augmentation: This
involves creating new training examples by applying various transformations to the existing data.
This helps to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to
generalize. 4. Splitting the data: This involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and
testing sets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. 5. Feature extraction:
This involves extracting relevant features from the data that can be used to train the model. In the
case of audio and image data, this may involve extracting spectrograms or other visual
representations of the data. 6. Model selection: This involves selecting the appropriate deep
learning architecture for the task at hand, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a
recurrent neural network (RNN). 7. Hyperparameter tuning: This involves adjusting the parameters of
the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers, to optimize its
performance.  These preprocessing steps are critical for ensuring that the deep learning model is
trained effectively and can accurately classify the data.
