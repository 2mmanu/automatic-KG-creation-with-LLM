 The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. It is a
type of feedforward neural network that is effective for solving regression problems. It comprises
an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers in between. The network architecture
of MLP used in this study is illustrated in Figure 3 of the document.
