  The different versions of datasets are managed by using a reference library, which is a collection
of all images from Challenge 1. This reference library is then used to train a model, which is
applied to a test dataset from 22 robustly-identified species from recent field surveys by RMB. The
test dataset is generated by creating 20 spectrograms per species, resulting in a total of 440
spectrograms. These spectrograms are subjected to identification using the CNN developed in
Challenge 1. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing the predicted species to the
actual species. The model is then refined and retrained using a larger reference library and a more
limited set of candidate species, resulting in improved performance.
