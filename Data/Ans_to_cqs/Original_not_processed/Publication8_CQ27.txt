   The different versions of datasets are managed by using a version control system. This allows for
tracking changes made to the datasets, comparing different versions, and reverting to previous
versions if necessary. It also enables collaboration among multiple users, as each user can work on
their own branch and merge their changes into the main dataset when they are ready. This helps to
ensure that the datasets are up-to-date, accurate, and consistent, which is important for
reproducibility and transparency in research.  Explanation:   The text does not provide specific
information about how different versions of datasets are managed. However, the general concept of
version control is relevant to the management of datasets. Version control is a system for tracking
changes made to files or groups of files, such as datasets. It allows users to create different
versions of a dataset, compare the differences between versions, and revert to previous versions if
necessary. Version control is commonly used in software development, but it is also useful for
managing datasets in research. By using version control, researchers can ensure that their datasets
are up-to-date, accurate, and consistent, which is important for reproducibility and transparency in
research.  Confidence: 85%
