 The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the
deep learning model. However, it does mention that square patches were extracted with the labelled
pixel at their centre, and there is no restriction on the size of these patches. Instead of using
the whole image for training, patches at multiple scales centred around the given labelled pixels
were extracted. This technique is termed as spatial pyramid pooling (SPP). Therefore, it can be
inferred that some form of patch extraction and resizing is involved in the preprocessing step.
