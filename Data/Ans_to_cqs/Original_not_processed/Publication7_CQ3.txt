 The raw data was collected using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with a high-
resolution camera. The AUV was used to capture images of the coral reefs in the Abrolhos Islands.
The images were then used to generate mosaics and coral maps, which were used to quantify the coral
population and analyze the trends in coral population.
