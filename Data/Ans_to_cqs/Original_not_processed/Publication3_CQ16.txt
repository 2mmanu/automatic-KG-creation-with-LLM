 The convergence criteria or stopping condition for the training process is not explicitly stated in
the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training process was calibrated using
different numbers of training steps, and the optimum number of training steps was chosen based on
correct identification rate and processing time. The optimum number of training steps was 4000 for
all challenges except Challenge 3, where it was 8000.
