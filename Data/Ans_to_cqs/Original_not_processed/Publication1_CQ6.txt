 Yes, there are transformations and augmentations applied to the input data. The text mentions that
the input data is a 384-dimensional feature vector of elemental signal descriptors. It is
transformed using t-SNE data clustering to identify distinct signal types in the data. Additionally,
data augmentation techniques such as image cropping around the object of interest, contrast
enhancement, and consecutive frame differences are applied to images. For audio, 2D spectrograms of
an appropriate duration are displayed per panel, which can be seen as a form of data transformation.
These transformations and augmentations help to improve the performance of the deep learning models
used for classification and detection.
