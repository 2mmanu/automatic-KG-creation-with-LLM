 The architecture of the deep learning model in the pipeline is a 2-layered neural network used to
classify corals from non-corals. The model uses features learned using a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) technique for patch extraction. The SPP
technique makes the resulting features scale invariant.
