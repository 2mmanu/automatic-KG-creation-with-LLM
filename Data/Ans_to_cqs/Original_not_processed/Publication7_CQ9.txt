 The model was selected based on the performance of the classifier on the Benthoz15 dataset. The
authors achieved a classification accuracy greater than 90% in all of their experiments. The model
was then applied to the coral reef of the Abrolhos Islands to investigate the trends in coral
population and generate coral maps for this region. The framework detected the decreasing trend in
the coral population of this region as well.
