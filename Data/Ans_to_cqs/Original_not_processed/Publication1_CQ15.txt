  The provided context does not explicitly mention any optimization algorithms or learning rate
schedules used during training. However, it does mention that the authors used deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward neural networks (DNNs) to audio spectrogram and image
data. These networks typically use some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm, such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop, along with a learning rate schedule to control
the rate of learning during training. Without more specific information, it is not possible to say
which optimization algorithm or learning rate schedule was used.  Answer:  The provided context does
