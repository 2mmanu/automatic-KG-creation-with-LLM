 In the deep learning pipeline, the data formats used are images and bounding boxes. The images are
the input to the model and the bounding boxes are the annotations used for training and evaluating
the model. The bounding boxes are used to localise the objects in the image and classify them. The
bounding boxes are represented as a set of coordinates in the image.  Confidence: 90%
