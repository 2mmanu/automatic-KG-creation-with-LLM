  The provided context does not directly address the query about transparency in the decision-making
process regarding bias. However, it does mention that the study used a method called "stacking
species distribution models" to estimate species richness. This method combines the predictions of
each species' distribution model to estimate species richness. While the study does not explicitly
discuss transparency in the decision-making process regarding bias, it does mention that
probability-based stacking produced unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness.
This suggests that the study took steps to minimize bias in the estimation of species richness.
However, without further information, it is not possible to determine whether the decision-making
process regarding bias was transparent.
