 The authors address bias in the data by using probability-based stacking, which has been found to
produce unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness. This method combines the
predictions of each species' species distribution model (SDM) to estimate species richness. The
authors also use MODIS products, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index
(LAI), as input variables to estimate the potential plant species richness of South Korea. These
products are known to have high temporal and spatial resolution, making them suitable for monitoring
vegetation dynamics and estimating species richness. However, the authors do not explicitly mention
how they address bias in the MODIS products.
