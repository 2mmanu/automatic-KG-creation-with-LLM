 The model selection process considered the use of macro-ecological models and stacking species
distribution models (S-SDMs) to estimate species richness. The S-SDMs approach was chosen because it
combines the predictions of each speciesâ€™ SDM to estimate species richness, and probability-based
stacking produced unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness. The model was then
validated using independent tree plot datasets from the Korea Forest Service.
