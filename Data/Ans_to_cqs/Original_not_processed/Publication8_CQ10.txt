 The model selection process was not explicitly described in the text. However, the authors
mentioned that they used a deep learning model for organ detection. They also mentioned that they
used a subset of the annotated scans for training of the model and the rest for testing. The model
was then used to predict the type and location of plant organs on the test subset. The authors did
not provide any information about the model selection process or the comparison with other models.
