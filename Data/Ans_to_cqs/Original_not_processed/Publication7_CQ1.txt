 The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning
pipeline. However, it is mentioned that square patches were extracted with the labelled pixel at
their centre and there is no restriction on the size of these patches. It can be inferred that the
data format used for these patches is likely to be image files such as JPEG or PNG. Additionally,
the classiﬁcation process uses a 2-layered neural network, which typically takes ﬂat arrays of
numerical data as input. Therefore, it can be inferred that the image patches are likely to be
converted into ﬂat arrays of numerical data before being fed into the neural network.
