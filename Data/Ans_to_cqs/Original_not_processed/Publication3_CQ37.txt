 The ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the automated
species identification system include the potential for misidentification, the impact on the privacy
of individuals, and the potential for misuse of the technology. The developers ensured that the
system was tested extensively to minimize the risk of misidentification, and that the data used to
train the system was anonymized to protect the privacy of individuals. Additionally, the developers
considered the potential for misuse of the technology and implemented measures to prevent
unauthorized access and use.
