 The pipeline uses two models: a deep learning (DL) model and a species distribution model (SDM).
The DL model is used to estimate the plant species richness for both North and South Korea from the
original MODIS-driven NDVI and LAI images (15-arcseconds). The SDM model is used to estimate the
potential plant species richness of South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of
the 1574 species.
