 The model selection process considered the use of pre-trained CNN image representations extracted
from VGGnet to a coral reef classiﬁcation problem. The authors investigated the effectiveness of
their trained clas- siﬁer on unlabelled coral mosaics of the Abrolhos Islands. They generated coral
maps for this region and quantiﬁed the coral population automatically. The framework detected the
decreasing trend in the coral population of this region as well. The proposed framework is an
important step towards investigating the long-term effects of environmental change on the effective
sustenance of marine ecosystems automatically.
