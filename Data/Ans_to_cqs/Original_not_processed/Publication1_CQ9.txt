 The model selection process for a specific task is not explicitly mentioned in the provided
context. However, it is mentioned that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed
forward neural networks (DNNs) have been applied to audio spectrogram and image data for classifying
the presence or absence and activity rates of a number of different endangered species. It is also
mentioned that there is a long and exciting roadmap of DL-based improvements applied to biodiversity
monitoring, leveraging various desirable properties of DL algorithms such as transfer learning and
joint embedding space.
