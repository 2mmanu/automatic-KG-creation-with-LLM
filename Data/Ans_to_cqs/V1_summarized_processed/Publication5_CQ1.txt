The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include multitemporal remote sensing data, such as MODIS-derived NDVI and LAI images collected in 2009, and plant species richness data from South Korea. These data are co-registered, resampled, and used to estimate potential plant species richness patterns for North Korea using a state-of-the-art DL approach.
