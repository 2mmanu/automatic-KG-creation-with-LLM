The authors used different metrics for different problems. For the statistical feature importance test, they used the root mean square error. For the independent validation of species richness, they calculated the overall correlation and local correlations between the species richness from the independent datasets and the results from the S-SDMs and DL species richness model. For direct comparisons, the model results were used in ﬁtting and validating a model, respectively. They calculated the AUC for each bivariate model, and the AUC (area under the curve) was used to calculate Somers’ D for weighting all the possible bivariate models.
