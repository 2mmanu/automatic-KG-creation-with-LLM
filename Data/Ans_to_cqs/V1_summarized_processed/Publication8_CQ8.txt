The deep learning model in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture called Faster R-CNN, which consists of three modules: a deep CNN image feature extraction network based on the ResNet-50 architecture, a Region Proposal Network (RPN) used for detection of Regions of Interests (RoIs), and Fast R-CNN, which computes a classification score along with class-specific bounding box regression for each of these regions.
