The ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the system include minimizing the negative ecological impacts of repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers, reducing the costs of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations, and ensuring the privacy and security of any data collected. The system is designed to automate as much of the data processing and analysis as possible, using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as using natural language processing techniques to extract insights from unstructured data.
