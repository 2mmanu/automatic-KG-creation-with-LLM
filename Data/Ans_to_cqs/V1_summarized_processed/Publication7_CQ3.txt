The raw data was collected using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with a high-resolution camera, which captured images of the coral reefs in the Abrolhos Islands. These images were then used to generate mosaics and coral maps, which were used to quantify the coral population and analyze the trends in coral population.
