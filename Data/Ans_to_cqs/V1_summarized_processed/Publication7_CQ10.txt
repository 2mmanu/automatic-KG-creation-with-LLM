The model selection process considered the use of pre-trained CNN image representations extracted from VGGnet to classify coral reefs. The authors tested the trained classifier on unlabelled coral mosaics of the Abrolhos Islands and generated coral maps for this region, which detected a decreasing trend in the coral population.
