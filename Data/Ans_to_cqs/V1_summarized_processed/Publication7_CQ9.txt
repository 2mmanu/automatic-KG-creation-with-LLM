The model was selected based on the performance of the classifier on the Benthoz15 dataset, achieving a classification accuracy greater than 90% in all experiments. It was then applied to the coral reef of the Abrolhos Islands to investigate the trends in coral population and generate coral maps for this region, detecting the decreasing trend in the coral population of this region as well.
