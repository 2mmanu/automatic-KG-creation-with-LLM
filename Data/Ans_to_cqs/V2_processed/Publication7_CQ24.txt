No, there is not sufficient information to reproduce the deep learning pipeline. The paper provides a high-level overview of the proposed framework, but it lacks the necessary details to replicate the pipeline. For instance, it does not specify the architecture of the 2-layered neural network used for classifying corals from non-corals, nor does it provide the code or data used in the study.
