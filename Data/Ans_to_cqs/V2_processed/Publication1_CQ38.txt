The bias in the data is addressed by using a variety of sensors including microphones, cameras (visual, thermal, IR, and hyperspectral), accelerometers, and others. The raw data are collected and transmitted back to a central data store. From there, the data may be analyzed with a variety of different algorithms. This approach helps to alleviate the sampling, variability, and bias problems associated with traditional surveys.
