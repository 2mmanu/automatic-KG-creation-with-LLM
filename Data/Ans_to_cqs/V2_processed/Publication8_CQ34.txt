The trained model is not deployed. The reason for this is not mentioned in the provided text. However, the text does mention that the model was trained twice, once with a training subset of 498 images on a single GPU for 9000 iterations and performance evaluated on the test subset of 155 images, also on a single GPU. Then, the model was trained again on all 653 annotated images on three GPUs for 18000 iterations for predicting plant organs on another un-annotated independent dataset. The text also mentions that the Python code and the trained model have been made available at GitHub. Therefore, it is possible that the model was not deployed because the authors decided to make the model available for others to use and deploy instead.
