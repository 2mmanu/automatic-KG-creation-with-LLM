The annotations or labels are used in the model as the target variable, which is the variable that the model is trying to predict. In this case, the annotations or labels are the species richness values for each grid cell. The model uses these values to learn the relationship between the input variables (such as NDVI and LAI) and the target variable, and then uses this relationship to predict the species richness for new, unseen data.
