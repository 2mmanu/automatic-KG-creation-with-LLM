The paper does not explicitly mention how uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is captured. However, it does mention that the proposed method automatically quantifies coral coverage in the Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia. This suggests that the method provides some measure of certainty or uncertainty in its predictions, but the specifics are not provided in the text.
