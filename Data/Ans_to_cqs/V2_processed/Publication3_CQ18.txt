The TensorFlow model was trained on a desktop computer with an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU, 32 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Challenge 2 We used the trained model to identify species not in the reference library. The overall correct identification rate was 50. 0%. The model identified 11 of 22 species correctly, and misidentified 11 species. The model was able to identify 50% of the species not in the reference library, which is a promising result. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. The overall correct identification rate was 88. 2%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 20, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species P. isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rates, respectively. Challenge 4 We used distributional data (Brown et al. 2015b; Diesmos et al. 2015) to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co- distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. The overall correct identification rate was 92. 5%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 13, species. Discussion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely-related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate-recognition cues (mating calls). We used TensorFlow to distinguish among 20 species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis, with an overall correct identification rate of 94. 3%. We also used TensorFlow to identify species not in the reference library, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 50. We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 88. Finally, we used distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 92. Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 651 The results of our study are promising, but there are some limitations. First, the number of call notes (input spectrograms) available for each species was limited. To address this, future studies should access more recordings per species, particularly those represented now by recordings of few individuals. Second, model validation was a challenge. We would have been more satisfied with our evaluation if we had more recordings from numerous individuals to utilize k-fold cross-validation (Kohavi 1995) instead of leave-one-out approaches, because the former offers greater independence between calibration and evaluation datasets. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely- related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls).

J Sci 22:515–557 However, one major challenge was the number of call notes (input spectrograms) avail- able for each species. Despite this limitation, our study is a novel use of a deep-learning platform to distinguish between closely- related species of frogs using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls). A second challenge, also related to sample size, was model validation. Taxonomic identification In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning technology for reliably identi- fying—and distinguishing among—closely-related species of frogs, as exemplified by single- note call segments (Fig. 1). Given known phylogenetic relationships (Brown et al. 2015b), we were surprised that multiple closely-related species pairs were distinguished from one another perfectly (100% success). For example, species pairs P. indeprensus and P. mim- ulus (both members of the subgenus Lupacolus), P. hazelae and P. montanus (subgenus Tirahanulap), and P. levigatus and P. insulatus (subgenus Lahatnanguri) could each be predicted, by virtue of their close phylogenetic relationships, to have similar spectral (fre- quency-related) and temporal (time- related) call properties—which they do (Fig. Still, with only a single isolated note per species, TensorFlow is able to distinguish them and correctly classify species’ identity, when presented with a large sample of positively identi- fied individual notes (i. e. , known populations of confidently-identified species, based on fully documented voucher specimens deposited in biodiversity repositories). Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 649 found on those islands. Finally, we calculated the overall correct identification rate across 15 islands to compare with that based on the full reference library. Results We calibrated models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows: Challenge 1 We created a confusion matrix to depict TensorFlow’s initial results with 20 species (Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely- related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct Fig. 3 Confusion matrix for 20 currently recognized species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis (Brown et al. 2015b), using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique.

We did not detect any systematic errors in TensorFlow classifi- cation, such as repeatedly confusing one species with another. Challenge 2
