The uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the authors do mention that they used k-fold cross-validation with k = 5 to fit the models and averaged the 5 results for the final suitability result for each species. This approach can help to reduce uncertainty and increase the robustness of the model predictions. Additionally, the authors mention that they used probability-based stacking to combine the predictions of each speciesâ€™ SDM to estimate species richness, which can also help to capture uncertainty in the model predictions. However, the specific methods used to capture uncertainty or confidence in the model predictions are not provided in the context.
