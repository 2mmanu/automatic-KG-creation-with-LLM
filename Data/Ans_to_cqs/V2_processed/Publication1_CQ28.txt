The provided context does not explicitly mention how updates to datasets are documented. However, it does mention that analysts use tools for audio and image data exploration to search for expected species and flag unknown or unexpected events, and that they create labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning models. It is possible that updates to datasets are documented through version control or change logs, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
