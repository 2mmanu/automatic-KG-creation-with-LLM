The raw data was collected by manually localizing and labeling plant organs from herbarium specimens. This process encountered difficulties such as distinguishing between buds, flowers, and fruits, separating different plant organs in some taxa, and differentiating between roots and stolons or other stem structures. In all of these cases, labeled boxes were placed in a way to best characterize the respective plant organ, sometimes including parts of other organs and, at other times, leaving out difficult parts if sufficient clearly assignable material were available.
