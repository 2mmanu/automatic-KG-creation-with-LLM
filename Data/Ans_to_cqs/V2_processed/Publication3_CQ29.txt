The data is labeled with the species of the frog that is vocalizing. Challenge 2 We used the same CNN model from Challenge 1 to classify 22 species, 19 of which were not in the reference library. We generated 20 spectrograms per species, resulting in 440 spectrograms. The overall correct identification rate was 64. 1%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 15, species. The lowest identification rates were for Platymantis sp. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, with 0% correct identification rate. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. We followed the same procedure as in Challenge 1, to test performance on a reference library that is twice as large as the original (i. e. , 41 classes). The overall correct identification rate was 94. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 17, species. Challenge 4 We used distributional data (Brown et al. 2015b; Diesmos et al. 2015) to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). First, we grouped the 41 species (20 described species, plus 21 undescribed candidate species) based on Philippine islands they inhabit, resulting in 15 subsets of co-occurring species in “communities” of 3 to 27 species (Fig. 2). Then, we trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. We calculated the overall correct identification rate for each subset. The overall correct identification rate was 98. 7%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 13, and 90% or above for 15, subsets. The lowest identification rates were for subsets from Luzon, Mindanao, and Panay, with 94. 6, 95. 0, and 95. 0% correct identification rate, respectively. Conclusion We used TensorFlow to classify 20 species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis, using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. 3%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rate, respectively. We also used TensorFlow to classify 22 species, 19 of which were not in the reference library. We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. We used distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset.
