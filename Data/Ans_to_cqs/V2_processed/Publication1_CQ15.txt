The provided context does not explicitly mention any optimization algorithms or learning rate schedules used during training. However, it does mention that the authors used deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward neural networks (DNNs) to audio spectrogram and image data. These networks typically use some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop, along with a learning rate schedule to control the rate of learning during training. Without more specific information, it is not possible to say which optimization algorithm or learning rate schedule was used.
