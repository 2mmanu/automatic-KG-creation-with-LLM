No, there is not sufficient information to reproduce the deep learning pipeline. The paper provides some details about the deep learning models used, such as the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward neural networks (DNNs) for audio spectrogram and image data. However, it does not provide enough details about the architecture of the models, the training data, the training process, or the evaluation metrics used to reproduce the pipeline. Additionally, the paper references external data and code that are not provided, making it impossible to fully reproduce the pipeline.
