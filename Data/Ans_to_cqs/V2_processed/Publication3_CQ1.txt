The deep learning pipeline typically involves the use of various data formats, including: 1. Raw data: This is the initial data format, which can be in various forms such as images, audio files, text files, etc. 2. Preprocessed data: This is the data format obtained after preprocessing the raw data. Preprocessing can involve various steps such as data cleaning, data augmentation, normalization, etc. 3. Training data: This is the data format used to train the deep learning model. It is typically a subset of the preprocessed data, and is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values. 4. Validation data: This is the data format used to validate the deep learning model during the training process. It is a subset of the preprocessed data that is separate from the training data, and is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 5. Test data: This is the data format used to evaluate the final performance of the deep learning model. It is a subset of the preprocessed data that is separate from the training and validation data, and is used to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. 6. Model data: This is the data format used to store the trained deep learning model. It typically includes the model's architecture, weights, and other parameters that have been learned during the training process. 7. Prediction data: This is the data format used to make predictions using the trained deep learning model. It can be in various forms such as images, audio files, text files, etc. , and is used as input to the model to generate predictions.
