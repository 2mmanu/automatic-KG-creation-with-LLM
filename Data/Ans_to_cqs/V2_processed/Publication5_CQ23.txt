Yes, the authors used different metrics for different problems. For the statistical feature importance test (SFIT), they used the root mean square error (RMSE) as the performance metric. For the independent validation of species richness, they calculated the overall correlation and local correlations between the species richness from the independent datasets and the results from the S-SDMs and DL species richness model. For direct comparisons, the model results were used in ﬁtting and validating a model, respectively. They calculated the AUC for each bivariate model, and the AUC (area under the curve) was used to calculate Somers’ D for weighting all the possible bivariate models. Somers’ D is D = 2 × (AUC—0. 5), and bivariate models with a Somers’ D lower than 0 (i. e. , AUC < 0. 5) were not used to build the ensemble range models. Finally, the suitability of the species was averaged by constructing the ensembles of bivariate models 5 times. For the species with 50 or more occurrence records, they used all 8 predictor variables and ﬁtted the models 5 times using k-fold cross-validation with k = 5. They averaged the 5 results for the ﬁnal suitability result for each species.
