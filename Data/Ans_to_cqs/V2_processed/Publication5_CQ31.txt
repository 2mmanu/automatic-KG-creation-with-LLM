The deep learning model generates predictions of potential plant species richness for the Korean Peninsula, including North Korea, which has limited survey data. It does this by combining the suitability predictions of 1574 species using species distribution models and multitemporal remote sensing data. The model is able to estimate potential plant species richness over the entire Korean Peninsula at a higher resolution than in previous efforts and identify which variables at which time periods are more important for estimating plant species richness. The deep learning model used in this study is a pixel-wise multilayer perceptron (MLP) which is a type of feedforward neural network that is effective for solving regression problems.
