The bias in the data is addressed by using distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). This helps to reduce bias by limiting the possible universe of a species’ identification to the biogeographically-relevant species pools.
