Yes, privacy and security measures are implemented in handling sensitive data. The system uses a variety of sensors including microphones, cameras (visual, thermal, IR, and hyperspectral), accelerometers, and other concepts, designs, and techniques for estimating population parameters. These sensors collect raw data that are transmitted back to a central data store. To ensure privacy and security, the data are encrypted during transmission and storage. Access to the data is restricted to authorized personnel only, and all access is logged for auditing purposes. Additionally, the data are anonymized to protect the identities of individuals or organizations that may be associated with the data. These measures help to ensure that sensitive data are handled securely and ethically.
