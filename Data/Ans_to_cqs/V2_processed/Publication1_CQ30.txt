The annotations or labels are used to train and refine the deep learning models. They are used to create labeled datasets that the models can learn from, and to manually review and audit the output of the existing models to improve their accuracy. The models output the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class, and analysts can sort the data accordingly to identify common signal types or anomalies. The models can also be improved through techniques such as transfer learning and joint embedding space, where models trained for one species can be used to improve results on related species, and where multiple types of sensors can be combined into a single model that outperforms each individual sensor modality.
