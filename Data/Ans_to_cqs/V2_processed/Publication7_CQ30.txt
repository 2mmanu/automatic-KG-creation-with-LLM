The annotations or labels are used to train a deep network which then classifies unlabelled images and mosaics. Marine experts are included in this pipeline to give feedback on the classiﬁcation accuracy. The best performing classiﬁer is then used to generate coral maps from the mosaics of the Abrolhos Islands.
