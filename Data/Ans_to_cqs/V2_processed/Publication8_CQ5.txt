Before training the deep learning model, the herbarium scans were rescaled from their original average size of ca. 5100 by 3500 pixels to 1200 by 800 pixels, in order to preserve the aspect ratio of the scans and to speed up the learning by reducing the number of pixels. The images were selected manually from a large collection of scans, having minimum visual overlap between organs, while covering a broad range of taxa and morphology. All these images were annotated for six different types of organs using LabelImg, a Python graphical toolkit for image annotation using bounding boxes. The average rate for manual image annotation was 8 to 15 herbarium sheets per hour, depending on the difficulty and number of bounding boxes to be annotated. The total number of annotated bounding boxes for all 653 images was 19654, with an average of 30. 1 bounding boxes per image. From these 653 annotated images, 155 of them were either annotated or verified by an expert, making a validated subset hence used for testing and the 498 were used for training.
