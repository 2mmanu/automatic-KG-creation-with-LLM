Yes, there are post-processing steps applied to the model's output. After the model predicts the type and location of plant organs on the test subset, a subset of these predictions is manually verified and corrected to evaluate the predictions. Additionally, the organ detection model was used to predict the type and location of plant organs on an un-annotated dataset, and around 200 of these scans were annotated by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes. The predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate these scans, since the predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate. After being annotated, these scans were compared with the predictions to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model on this dataset.
