The data is annotated with bounding boxes for six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. Introduction Herbarium specimens are an invaluable resource for research in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. With the increasing digitisation of herbarium collections, the amount of available data is growing rapidly. However, the information contained in these images is not easily accessible and requires manual annotation. The presence of certain plant organs on herbarium sheets is useful information in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. Automatic recognition of these organs will help mobilise such information. In this study, we use deep learning to detect plant organs on digitised herbarium specimens. We use Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) to detect and localise six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. We manually annotated hundreds of herbarium scans with thousands of bounding boxes for these six types of plant organs and used them for training and evaluating the plant organ detection model.
