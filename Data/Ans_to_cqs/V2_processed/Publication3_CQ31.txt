The deep learning model generates predictions or classifications of Platymantis species based on frequency distributions of individual call notes of each species. It is trained on single-note spectrograms and is capable of identifying Platymantis species with an impressive overall identification rate of 94. 3%. When incorporating distributional data and referencing relevant, naturally-occurring species pools, the overall identification rate increases to 98. 7%. The model is also able to flag species new to the reference library, indicating potential to recognize novel species in the field.
