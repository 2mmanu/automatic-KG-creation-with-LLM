The paper does not explicitly mention any measures taken to explain model predictions. However, it does mention that the model was manually verified and corrected to evaluate the predictions on the Herbarium Senckenbergianum dataset. This process likely involved comparing the model's predictions to the actual annotations and making adjustments as necessary to ensure the accuracy of the model. Additionally, the paper mentions that the annotations for the Herbarium Senckenbergianum dataset were done based on the predictions of organs on scans. This suggests that the predictions were used to guide the annotation process, which could also be considered a form of explanation for the model's predictions.
