Before training the deep learning model, the following preprocessing steps were involved: 1. The MODIS-derived NDVI and LAI images collected in 2009 were co-registered. 2. Pixel-wise MLP was used to estimate species richness. 3. The missing values at different pixel locations and times due to high cloud cover were handled by using multilayer perception, which comprises more than one perceptron, which consists of an input layer to receive the signal, an output layer that makes a decision, and one in between those two.
