The specific hyperparameters were selected based on the results of a grid search, which is a systematic method for exploring the hyperparameter space and identifying the best combination of hyperparameters for the model. The grid search was performed using a validation set, which is a subset of the training data that is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. The hyperparameters that resulted in the best performance on the validation set were then selected for use in the final model.
