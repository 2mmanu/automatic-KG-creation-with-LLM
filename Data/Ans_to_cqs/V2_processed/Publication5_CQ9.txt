The model was selected based on the root mean square error (RMSE) as the performance metric. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance decreased with random shuffling. The feature with the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals was determined using a statistical feature importance test (SFIT). The SFIT involved randomly shuffling a single feature while keeping all the other features constant, and iterating this process by changing the test variable. The feature importance was then calculated based on the decrease in model performance.
