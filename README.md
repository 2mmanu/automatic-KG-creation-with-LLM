# Automatic Ontology and Knowledge Graph Construction with LLM

This repository contains code, data, prompts and results related to the (semi-)automatic pipeline of  Ontology and Knowledge Graph Construction with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

In this project, we explore the potential of utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for the generation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This work explores the (semi-)automatic construction of KGs facilitated by open-source LLMs. Our pipeline involves formulating competency questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal to no involvement of human experts. We showcase the feasibility of our semi-automated pipeline by creating a KG on deep learning methodologies by exploiting scholarly publications. To evaluate the answers generated via Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) as well as the KG concepts automatically extracted using LLMs, we design a judge LLM, which rates the generated content based on ground truth.
The repository encompasses various components including code for data preprocessing, prompts used for LLMs, datasets employed in experiments, and the corresponding results obtained.
