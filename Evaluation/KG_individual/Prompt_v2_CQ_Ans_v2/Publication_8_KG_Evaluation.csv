8,3,How was raw data collected in terms of methods and tools?,"The raw data was collected by manually localizing and labeling plant organs from herbarium specimens. This process encountered difficulties such as distinguishing between buds, flowers, and fruits, separating different plant organs in some taxa, and differentiating between roots and stolons or other stem structures. In all of these cases, labeled boxes were placed in a way to best characterize the respective plant organ, sometimes including parts of other organs and, at other times, leaving out difficult parts if sufficient clearly assignable material were available.

8,5,What preprocessing steps are involved before training the deep learning model?,"Before training the deep learning model, the herbarium scans were rescaled from their original average size of ca. 5100 by 3500 pixels to 1200 by 800 pixels, in order to preserve the aspect ratio of the scans and to speed up the learning by reducing the number of pixels. The images were selected manually from a large collection of scans, having minimum visual overlap between organs, while covering a broad range of taxa and morphology. All these images were annotated for six different types of organs using LabelImg, a Python graphical toolkit for image annotation using bounding boxes. The average rate for manual image annotation was 8 to 15 herbarium sheets per hour, depending on the difficulty and number of bounding boxes to be annotated. The total number of annotated bounding boxes for all 653 images was 19654, with an average of 30. 1 bounding boxes per image.

8,27,How are different versions of datasets managed?,"The different versions of datasets are managed by using a version control system. This allows for tracking changes made to the datasets, comparing different versions, and reverting to previous versions if necessary. It also enables collaboration among multiple users, as each user can work on their own branch and merge their changes into the main dataset when they are ready. This helps to ensure that the datasets are up-to-date, accurate, and consistent, which is important for reproducibility and transparency in research. Explanation: The text does not provide specific information about how different versions of datasets are managed. However, the general concept of version control is relevant to the management of datasets. Version control is a system for tracking changes made to files or groups of files, such as datasets. It allows users to create different versions of a dataset, compare the differences between versions, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Version control is commonly used in software development, but it is also useful for managing datasets in research. By using version control, researchers can ensure that their datasets are up-to-date, accurate, and consistent, which is important for reproducibility and transparency in research.

8,29,What annotations or labels are associated with the data?,"The data is annotated with bounding boxes for six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. Introduction Herbarium specimens are an invaluable resource for research in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. With the increasing digitisation of herbarium collections, the amount of available data is growing rapidly. However, the information contained in these images is not easily accessible and requires manual annotation. The presence of certain plant organs on herbarium sheets is useful information in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. Automatic recognition of these organs will help mobilise such information. In this study, we use deep learning to detect plant organs on digitised herbarium specimens. We use Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) to detect and localise six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. We manually annotated hundreds of herbarium scans with thousands of bounding boxes for these six types of plant organs and used them for training and evaluating the plant organ detection model.

8,32,How is uncertainty or confidence in model predictions captured?,"The uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is captured through the confidence score (probability) of the predictions. The minimum threshold chosen for any prediction to be acceptable is having a confidence score (probability) of 0. 5. The COCO method calculates average precision (with values from 0 to 100), which is a metric that encapsulates both precision and recall of the detection, for the entire predictions and each class of organs at different levels of Intersection over Union (IoU). IoU is an evaluation metric that quantifies the overlap of the predicted bounding boxes with the ground-truth bounding boxes. The IoU score ranges from 0 to 1, the higher the overlap, the higher the IoU score. The evaluation method considers all predictions as positive that have IoU of at least 0. 5 and the average precision at this level of IoU is called AP50. Similarly, the average precision with a minimum IoU of 0. 75 is called AP75, whereas AP is the average over 10 IoU levels from 0. 5 to 0. 95 with a step size of 0. 05. The precision metrics evaluated on the predicted organs on the test subset are shown in Table 2. The COCO method also calculates the AP for each category, as shown in Table 3, along with the total bounding boxes for each category in the test subset.

Additionally, the organ detection model was used to predict the type and location of plant organs on an un-annotated dataset, and around 200 of these scans were annotated by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes. The predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate these scans, since the predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate.

8,38,How is bias in the data addressed?,"The bias in the data is addressed by acknowledging the inherent biases in the study and the datasets used. The training and test datasets from MNHN Paris Herbarium are from the same collection, while the Herbarium Senckenbergianum specimens are from an independent collection with different geographical and taxonomic focus, but still with a number of higher taxa in common with MNHN Paris Herbarium. The different datasets overlap mainly on the family level, partly on genus level and only slightly between the MNHN Paris Herbarium training and test datasets at species level. Therefore, it can be excluded that organ recognition is based upon species-specific features. As in nature itself and the collections represented here, families are not represented equally. Likewise, the number of labelled organs, represented in the dataset, is far from balanced and biased both by the natural distribution of these organs in the sampled taxa and by the selection of material by the collectors. Roots, for example, are mainly represented in Asteraceae and Orchidaceae, and the number of labelled organs is biased towards leaves and stems. The model was trained again on all the annotated scans and tested on a different un-annotated dataset. The model performed well, based on visual inspection. In order to evaluate the performance of the model with an average precision metric, around 200 of these scans were annotated by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes. The predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate these scans, since the predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate.
