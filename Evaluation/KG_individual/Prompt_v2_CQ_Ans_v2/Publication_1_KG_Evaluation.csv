1,3,How was raw data collected in terms of methods and tools?,"Raw data was collected using various methods and tools, including audio and image sensors, GPS tracking devices, and high-definition imagery. These tools were used to capture sounds, images, and locations of various wildlife species. The data was then processed and analyzed using software tools for data exploration, labeling, and auditing. These tools allowed analysts to search for expected species, flag unknown or unexpected events, create labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning models, and manually review and audit the output of existing deep learning models. The data was also explored and filtered according to date ranges, time of day, site location, and elemental attributes such as frequency ranges, click-like or whistle-like sounds, rising tones or falling tones, repetitive pulses, fast or slow moving objects, large or small objects, the presence of eye- shine, and certain colors. Modalities were combined as well, such as images being selected according to time periods when a specified sound occurred. ",Method,https://w3id.org/dlprovenance#MethodTool_1,electronic sensors
