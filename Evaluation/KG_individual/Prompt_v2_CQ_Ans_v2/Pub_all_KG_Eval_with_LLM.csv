3,18,What hardware infrastructures are used for model training?,"The TensorFlow model was trained on a desktop computer with an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU, 32 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Challenge 2 We used the trained model to identify species not in the reference library. The overall correct identification rate was 50. 0%. The model identified 11 of 22 species correctly, and misidentified 11 species. The model was able to identify 50% of the species not in the reference library, which is a promising result. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. The overall correct identification rate was 88. 2%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 20, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species P. isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rates, respectively. Challenge 4 We used distributional data (Brown et al. 2015b; Diesmos et al. 2015) to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co- distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. The overall correct identification rate was 92. 5%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 13, species. Discussion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely-related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate-recognition cues (mating calls). We used TensorFlow to distinguish among 20 species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis, with an overall correct identification rate of 94. 3%. We also used TensorFlow to identify species not in the reference library, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 50. We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 88. Finally, we used distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 92. Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 651 The results of our study are promising, but there are some limitations. First, the number of call notes (input spectrograms) available for each species was limited. To address this, future studies should access more recordings per species, particularly those represented now by recordings of few individuals. Second, model validation was a challenge. We would have been more satisfied with our evaluation if we had more recordings from numerous individuals to utilize k-fold cross-validation (Kohavi 1995) instead of leave-one-out approaches, because the former offers greater independence between calibration and evaluation datasets. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely- related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls).

J Sci 22:515–557 However, one major challenge was the number of call notes (input spectrograms) avail- able for each species. Despite this limitation, our study is a novel use of a deep-learning platform to distinguish between closely- related species of frogs using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls). A second challenge, also related to sample size, was model validation. Taxonomic identification In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning technology for reliably identi- fying—and distinguishing among—closely-related species of frogs, as exemplified by single- note call segments (Fig. 1). Given known phylogenetic relationships (Brown et al. 2015b), we were surprised that multiple closely-related species pairs were distinguished from one another perfectly (100% success). For example, species pairs P. indeprensus and P. mim- ulus (both members of the subgenus Lupacolus), P. hazelae and P. montanus (subgenus Tirahanulap), and P. levigatus and P. insulatus (subgenus Lahatnanguri) could each be predicted, by virtue of their close phylogenetic relationships, to have similar spectral (fre- quency-related) and temporal (time- related) call properties—which they do (Fig. Still, with only a single isolated note per species, TensorFlow is able to distinguish them and correctly classify species’ identity, when presented with a large sample of positively identi- fied individual notes (i. e. , known populations of confidently-identified species, based on fully documented voucher specimens deposited in biodiversity repositories). Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 649 found on those islands. Finally, we calculated the overall correct identification rate across 15 islands to compare with that based on the full reference library. Results We calibrated models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows: Challenge 1 We created a confusion matrix to depict TensorFlow’s initial results with 20 species (Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely- related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct Fig. 3 Confusion matrix for 20 currently recognized species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis (Brown et al. 2015b), using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique.

3,29,What annotations or labels are associated with the data?,"The data is labeled with the species of the frog that is vocalizing. Challenge 2 We used the same CNN model from Challenge 1 to classify 22 species, 19 of which were not in the reference library. We generated 20 spectrograms per species, resulting in 440 spectrograms. The overall correct identification rate was 64. 1%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 15, species. The lowest identification rates were for Platymantis sp. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, with 0% correct identification rate. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. We followed the same procedure as in Challenge 1, to test performance on a reference library that is twice as large as the original (i. e. , 41 classes). The overall correct identification rate was 94. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 17, species. Challenge 4 We used distributional data (Brown et al. 2015b; Diesmos et al. 2015) to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). First, we grouped the 41 species (20 described species, plus 21 undescribed candidate species) based on Philippine islands they inhabit, resulting in 15 subsets of co-occurring species in “communities” of 3 to 27 species (Fig. 2). Then, we trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. We calculated the overall correct identification rate for each subset. The overall correct identification rate was 98. 7%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 13, and 90% or above for 15, subsets. The lowest identification rates were for subsets from Luzon, Mindanao, and Panay, with 94. 6, 95. 0, and 95. 0% correct identification rate, respectively. Conclusion We used TensorFlow to classify 20 species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis, using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. 3%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rate, respectively.

8,29,What annotations or labels are associated with the data?,"The data is annotated with bounding boxes for six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. Introduction Herbarium specimens are an invaluable resource for research in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. With the increasing digitisation of herbarium collections, the amount of available data is growing rapidly. However, the information contained in these images is not easily accessible and requires manual annotation. The presence of certain plant organs on herbarium sheets is useful information in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. Automatic recognition of these organs will help mobilise such information. In this study, we use deep learning to detect plant organs on digitised herbarium specimens. We use Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) to detect and localise six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. We manually annotated hundreds of herbarium scans with thousands of bounding boxes for these six types of plant organs and used them for training and evaluating the plant organ detection model.

8,32,How is uncertainty or confidence in model predictions captured?,"The uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is captured through the confidence score (probability) of the predictions. The minimum threshold chosen for any prediction to be acceptable is having a confidence score (probability) of 0. 5. The COCO method calculates average precision (with values from 0 to 100), which is a metric that encapsulates both precision and recall of the detection, for the entire predictions and each class of organs at different levels of Intersection over Union (IoU). IoU is an evaluation metric that quantifies the overlap of the predicted bounding boxes with the ground-truth bounding boxes. The IoU score ranges from 0 to 1, the higher the overlap, the higher the IoU score. The evaluation method considers all predictions as positive that have IoU of at least 0. 5 and the average precision at this level of IoU is called AP50. Similarly, the average precision with a minimum IoU of 0. 75 is called AP75, whereas AP is the average over 10 IoU levels from 0. 5 to 0. 95 with a step size of 0. 05. The precision metrics evaluated on the predicted organs on the test subset are shown in Table 2. The COCO method also calculates the AP for each category, as shown in Table 3, along with the total bounding boxes for each category in the test subset.

8,38,How is bias in the data addressed?,"The bias in the data is addressed by acknowledging the inherent biases in the study and the datasets used. The training and test datasets from MNHN Paris Herbarium are from the same collection, while the Herbarium Senckenbergianum specimens are from an independent collection with different geographical and taxonomic focus, but still with a number of higher taxa in common with MNHN Paris Herbarium. The different datasets overlap mainly on the family level, partly on genus level and only slightly between the MNHN Paris Herbarium training and test datasets at species level. Therefore, it can be excluded that organ recognition is based upon species-specific features. As in nature itself and the collections represented here, families are not represented equally. Likewise, the number of labelled organs, represented in the dataset, is far from balanced and biased both by the natural distribution of these organs in the sampled taxa and by the selection of material by the collectors. Roots, for example, are mainly represented in Asteraceae and Orchidaceae, and the number of labelled organs is biased towards leaves and stems. The model was trained again on all the annotated scans and tested on a different un-annotated dataset. The model performed well, based on visual inspection. In order to evaluate the performance of the model with an average precision metric, around 200 of these scans were annotated by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes. The predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate these scans, since the predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate. After being annotated, these scans were compared with the predictions to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model on this dataset.
