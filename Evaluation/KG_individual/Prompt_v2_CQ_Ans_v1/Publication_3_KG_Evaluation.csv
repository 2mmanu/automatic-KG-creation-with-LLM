3,37,What ethical considerations are taken into account during development and deployment?,"The ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the automated species identification system include the potential for misidentification, the impact on the privacy of individuals, and the potential for misuse of the technology. The developers tested the system extensively to minimize the risk of misidentification, anonymized the data used to train the system to protect individual privacy, and implemented measures to prevent unauthorized access and use of the technology.",EthicalImplication,https://w3id.org/dlprovenance#EthicalImplication_1,not provided
3,38,How is bias in the data addressed?,"The bias in the data is addressed by using distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task. This helps to reduce bias by limiting the possible universe of a species’ identification to the biogeographically-relevant species pools.",BiasAddressing,https://w3id.org/dlprovenance#BiasAddressing_1,not provided
3,39,Is there transparency in the decision-making process regarding bias?,There is no transparency in the decision-making process regarding bias.,Transparency,https://w3id.org/dlprovenance#Transparency_1,not provided
