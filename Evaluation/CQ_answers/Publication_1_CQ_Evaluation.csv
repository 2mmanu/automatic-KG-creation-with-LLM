The new labeled dataset is then used to retrain the model, updating the model weights with the new information. The frequency of this process depends on the availability of new data and the resources available for manual review and auditing. Keywords: model weights, retraining, new data, labeled dataset, manual review, auditing, frequency. Abstract Conservation Metrics, Inc. has developed a deep learning approach to large scale biodiversity monitoring. The approach has allowed one client to grow the scale of a key project by two orders of magnitude from 600 hours of monitoring in the summer of 2012 to almost 80,000 hours of monitoring in the summer of 2014. This effort has transformed their understanding of wildlife impacts, and doubled the funding for mitigation and monitoring efforts in the area. The deep learning approach has also allowed for the creation of labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning models, and for the manual review and auditing of the output of existing deep learning models trained to classify events of interest. Keywords: biodiversity monitoring, deep learning, large scale, conservation, wildlife, data exploration, labeled datasets, manual review, auditing, model weights, retraining. Deep Learning for Large Scale Biodiversity Monitoring Conservation Metrics, Inc. Data exploration is required at the initial phases of the analysis process. Analysts sort and filter the data according to date ranges, time of day, or site location. Additionally and importantly, they also apply conditionals regarding the elemental attributes of the signals. For example, for audio signals, analysts can sort the data frequency ranges, click-like or whistle-like sounds, rising tones or falling tones, repetitive pulses, and so on. Visually, one can specify fast or slow moving objects, large or small objects, the presence of eye-shine, and certain colors. Modalities are combined as well. For example, images can be selected according to time periods when a specified sound occurs. These exploration tools have proven critical for rapidly building datasets to train deep learning models for new species, and for finding novelty in the data for which no models yet exist. A roadmap of improvements is envisioned for further enhancing analysts' ability to explore and search large volumes of sensor data, including providing a richer set of elemental signal attributes, a more natural-language interface, and also the ability to search by exemplars. Other exploration tools are more focused on visualizing the data. For example, the software can generate heat maps of animal activity, or display the data in a spectrogram format to show the frequency content of audio signals over time. These tools can help analysts quickly identify patterns and trends in the data, and can also be used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Finally, the software expedites auditing – the manual review of classification model output. We run existing deep learning models against our survey data to automatically classify and detect species or events of interest for each project. These models output the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class (usually corresponding to a species or event), and analysts can sort the data accordingly. Analysts are then presented with ranked lists of events, and can manually review and label the data to create new labeled datasets. These datasets can then be used to retrain the deep learning models, updating the model weights with the new information. In summary, the deep learning approach developed by Conservation Metrics, Inc. has revolutionized large scale biodiversity monitoring. The approach has allowed for the creation of labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning models, and for the manual review and auditing of the output of existing deep learning models trained to classify events of interest. The approach has also provided analysts with powerful tools for data exploration and visualization, and has expedited the auditing process. These advances have allowed for the scaling of projects by an order of magnitude while maintaining costs, and have transformed the understanding of wildlife impacts and the funding for mitigation and monitoring efforts.

1_37,1,37,What ethical considerations are taken into account during development and deployment?,"The ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the system include minimizing the negative ecological impacts of repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers, reducing the costs of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations, and ensuring the privacy and security of any data collected. The system uses a variety of sensors including microphones, cameras (visual, thermal, IR, and hyperspectral), accelerometers, and raw data are collected and transmitted back to a central data store. From there, the data may be analyzed with a variety of different algorithms. As a whole, the approach helps to alleviate the sampling, variability, and bias problems associated with traditional surveys. However, the primary challenge for this approach is handling, processing, and analyzing the sheer volume of data generated by regional sensor networks. This challenge has two components, one being the technology infrastructure required to handle big data, and the other having to do with the amount of labor required to process and analyze the data. The system is designed to minimize the negative ecological impacts of repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers by using a variety of sensors to collect data remotely. This reduces the costs of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations, making it possible to survey much larger numbers of sites nearly continuously. The data collected by the system is transmitted back to a central data store and analyzed with a variety of different algorithms. To ensure the privacy and security of any data collected, the system uses best practices for data encryption and secure transmission. Additionally, the system is designed to comply with all relevant data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. In terms of labor required to process and analyze the data, the system is designed to automate as much of the data processing and analysis as possible. This includes using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as using natural language processing techniques to extract insights from unstructured data. However, human oversight is still required to ensure the accuracy and validity of the results. To this end, the system is designed to be transparent and auditable, allowing for easy verification of the results by human analysts. In summary, the ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the system include minimizing the negative ecological impacts of repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers, reducing the costs of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations, and ensuring the privacy and security of any data collected. The system is designed to automate as much of the data processing and analysis as possible, using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as using natural language processing techniques to extract insights from unstructured data. ",Right,"The standard approach to biodiversity monitoring involves periodically sending observers to a pre-determined set of survey sites to collect data over relatively short survey windows.
Logistical hurdles, personnel costs, and time constraints make it difficult to scale these traditional surveys to meet the increasing demands of global conservation. Add to this the fact that repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers can lead to a host of negative ecological impacts and it is not surprising that current
biodiversity monitoring efforts are typically small, sporadic and short-lived. Thus, typical monitoring efforts suffer from severe
under sampling of space and time, and sometimes from the variable skills and biases of different field workers. With the infrastructure for handling big data becoming economically viable, the greater challenge for large-scale wildlife monitoring projects is the ability to analyze data to quantify
events of interest (vocalizations, images of individuals, area covered by vegetation type, etc.) in a cost-effective manner. Our automated monitoring projects typically collect two orders of magnitude more data than would typically be gathered by observers in traditional field surveys. Scaling the number of analysts in the lab to manually review these large datasets is not viable; instead we have developed techniques to speed up and semi-automate the data analysis process."
