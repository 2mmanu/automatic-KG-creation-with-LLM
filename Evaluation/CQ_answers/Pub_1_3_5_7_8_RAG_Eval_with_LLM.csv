1_36,1,36,How often are model weights updated by retraining with new data?,"The model weights are updated by retraining with new data every time a new labeled dataset is created. This is typically done after the analysts have manually reviewed and audited the output of the existing DL models trained to classify events of interest. The new labeled dataset is then used to retrain the model, updating the model weights with the new information. The frequency of this process depends on the availability of new data and the resources available for manual review and auditing. Keywords: model weights, retraining, new data, labeled dataset, manual review, auditing, frequency. Abstract Conservation Metrics, Inc. has developed a deep learning approach to large scale biodiversity monitoring. The approach has allowed one client to grow the scale of a key project by two orders of magnitude from 600 hours of monitoring in the summer of 2012 to almost 80,000 hours of monitoring in the summer of 2014. This effort has transformed their understanding of wildlife impacts, and doubled the funding for mitigation and monitoring efforts in the area. The deep learning approach has also allowed for the creation of labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning models, and for the manual review and auditing of the output of existing deep learning models trained to classify events of interest. Keywords: biodiversity monitoring, deep learning, large scale, conservation, wildlife, data exploration, labeled datasets, manual review, auditing, model weights, retraining. Deep Learning for Large Scale Biodiversity Monitoring Conservation Metrics, Inc. Data exploration is required at the initial phases of the analysis process. Analysts sort and filter the data according to date ranges, time of day, or site location. Additionally and importantly, they also apply conditionals regarding the elemental attributes of the signals. For example, for audio signals, analysts can sort the data frequency ranges, click-like or whistle-like sounds, rising tones or falling tones, repetitive pulses, and so on. Visually, one can specify fast or slow moving objects, large or small objects, the presence of eye-shine, and certain colors. Modalities are combined as well. For example, images can be selected according to time periods when a specified sound occurs. These exploration tools have proven critical for rapidly building datasets to train deep learning models for new species, and for finding novelty in the data for which no models yet exist. A roadmap of improvements is envisioned for further enhancing analysts' ability to explore and search large volumes of sensor data, including providing a richer set of elemental signal attributes, a more natural-language interface, and also the ability to search by exemplars. Other exploration tools are more focused on visualizing the data. For example, the software can generate heat maps of animal activity, or display the data in a spectrogram format to show the frequency content of audio signals over time. These tools can help analysts quickly identify patterns and trends in the data, and can also be used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Finally, the software expedites auditing – the manual review of classification model output. We run existing deep learning models against our survey data to automatically classify and detect species or events of interest for each project. These models output the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class (usually corresponding to a species or event), and analysts can sort the data accordingly. Analysts are then presented with ranked lists of events, and can manually review and label the data to create new labeled datasets. These datasets can then be used to retrain the deep learning models, updating the model weights with the new information. In summary, the deep learning approach developed by Conservation Metrics, Inc. has revolutionized large scale biodiversity monitoring. The approach has allowed for the creation of labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning models, and for the manual review and auditing of the output of existing deep learning models trained to classify events of interest. The approach has also provided analysts with powerful tools for data exploration and visualization, and has expedited the auditing process. These advances have allowed for the scaling of projects by an order of magnitude while maintaining costs, and have transformed the understanding of wildlife impacts and the funding for mitigation and monitoring efforts.

1_37,1,37,What ethical considerations are taken into account during development and deployment?,"The ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the system include minimizing the negative ecological impacts of repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers, reducing the costs of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations, and ensuring the privacy and security of any data collected. The system uses a variety of sensors including microphones, cameras (visual, thermal, IR, and hyperspectral), accelerometers, and raw data are collected and transmitted back to a central data store. From there, the data may be analyzed with a variety of different algorithms. As a whole, the approach helps to alleviate the sampling, variability, and bias problems associated with traditional surveys. However, the primary challenge for this approach is handling, processing, and analyzing the sheer volume of data generated by regional sensor networks. This challenge has two components, one being the technology infrastructure required to handle big data, and the other having to do with the amount of labor required to process and analyze the data. The system is designed to minimize the negative ecological impacts of repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers by using a variety of sensors to collect data remotely. This reduces the costs of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations, making it possible to survey much larger numbers of sites nearly continuously. The data collected by the system is transmitted back to a central data store and analyzed with a variety of different algorithms. To ensure the privacy and security of any data collected, the system uses best practices for data encryption and secure transmission. Additionally, the system is designed to comply with all relevant data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. In terms of labor required to process and analyze the data, the system is designed to automate as much of the data processing and analysis as possible. This includes using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as using natural language processing techniques to extract insights from unstructured data. However, human oversight is still required to ensure the accuracy and validity of the results. To this end, the system is designed to be transparent and auditable, allowing for easy verification of the results by human analysts. In summary, the ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the system include minimizing the negative ecological impacts of repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers, reducing the costs of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations, and ensuring the privacy and security of any data collected. The system is designed to automate as much of the data processing and analysis as possible, using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as using natural language processing techniques to extract insights from unstructured data. ",Right,"The standard approach to biodiversity monitoring involves periodically sending observers to a pre-determined set of survey sites to collect data over relatively short survey windows.
Logistical hurdles, personnel costs, and time constraints make it difficult to scale these traditional surveys to meet the increasing demands of global conservation. Add to this the fact that repeated visits to sensitive habitats by human observers can lead to a host of negative ecological impacts and it is not surprising that current
biodiversity monitoring efforts are typically small, sporadic and short-lived. Thus, typical monitoring efforts suffer from severe
under sampling of space and time, and sometimes from the variable skills and biases of different field workers. With the infrastructure for handling big data becoming economically viable, the greater challenge for large-scale wildlife monitoring projects is the ability to analyze data to quantify
events of interest (vocalizations, images of individuals, area covered by vegetation type, etc.) in a cost-effective manner. Our automated monitoring projects typically collect two orders of magnitude more data than would typically be gathered by observers in traditional field surveys. Scaling the number of analysts in the lab to manually review these large datasets is not viable; instead we have developed techniques to speed up and semi-automate the data analysis process.",10.0,The prediction answer is a perfect match to the ground truth.

3_18,3,18,What hardware infrastructures are used for model training?,"The TensorFlow model was trained on a desktop computer with an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU, 32 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Challenge 2 We used the trained model to identify species not in the reference library. The overall correct identification rate was 50. 0%. The model identified 11 of 22 species correctly, and misidentified 11 species. The model was able to identify 50% of the species not in the reference library, which is a promising result. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. The overall correct identification rate was 88. 2%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 20, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species P. isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rates, respectively. Challenge 4 We used distributional data (Brown et al. 2015b; Diesmos et al. 2015) to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co- distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. The overall correct identification rate was 92. 5%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 13, species. Discussion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely-related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate-recognition cues (mating calls). We used TensorFlow to distinguish among 20 species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis, with an overall correct identification rate of 94. 3%. We also used TensorFlow to identify species not in the reference library, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 50. We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 88. Finally, we used distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 92. Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 651 The results of our study are promising, but there are some limitations. First, the number of call notes (input spectrograms) available for each species was limited. To address this, future studies should access more recordings per species, particularly those represented now by recordings of few individuals. Second, model validation was a challenge. We would have been more satisfied with our evaluation if we had more recordings from numerous individuals to utilize k-fold cross-validation (Kohavi 1995) instead of leave-one-out approaches, because the former offers greater independence between calibration and evaluation datasets. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely- related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls).

J Sci 22:515–557 However, one major challenge was the number of call notes (input spectrograms) avail- able for each species. Despite this limitation, our study is a novel use of a deep-learning platform to distinguish between closely- related species of frogs using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls). A second challenge, also related to sample size, was model validation. Taxonomic identification In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning technology for reliably identi- fying—and distinguishing among—closely-related species of frogs, as exemplified by single- note call segments (Fig. 1). Given known phylogenetic relationships (Brown et al. 2015b), we were surprised that multiple closely-related species pairs were distinguished from one another perfectly (100% success). For example, species pairs P. indeprensus and P. mim- ulus (both members of the subgenus Lupacolus), P. hazelae and P. montanus (subgenus Tirahanulap), and P. levigatus and P. insulatus (subgenus Lahatnanguri) could each be predicted, by virtue of their close phylogenetic relationships, to have similar spectral (fre- quency-related) and temporal (time- related) call properties—which they do (Fig. Still, with only a single isolated note per species, TensorFlow is able to distinguish them and correctly classify species’ identity, when presented with a large sample of positively identi- fied individual notes (i. e. , known populations of confidently-identified species, based on fully documented voucher specimens deposited in biodiversity repositories). Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 649 found on those islands. Finally, we calculated the overall correct identification rate across 15 islands to compare with that based on the full reference library. Results We calibrated models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows: Challenge 1 We created a confusion matrix to depict TensorFlow’s initial results with 20 species (Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely- related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct Fig. 3 Confusion matrix for 20 currently recognized species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis (Brown et al. 2015b), using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique.

The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct classification, respectively. The overall correct identification rate was 92. 7%. Challenge 4 We used distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 13, and 90% or above for 14, subsets. The lowest identification rates were for subsets of species from the islands of Luzon and Mindoro, with 80% correct classification. The overall correct identification rate was 95. 3%.

We also tested TensorFlow to identify species not in the reference library. The lowest identification rates were for closely- related species Platymantis isarog and P. We also tested TensorFlow to identify all 41 species for which recordings are available.

This is important because single-note spectrograms are the most common type of data available for many species of frogs. Our results also demonstrate that TensorFlow can be used to identify species of Platymantis based on single-note spectrograms from species not in the reference library.

8_27,8,27,How are different versions of datasets managed?,"The different versions of datasets are managed by using a version control system. This allows for tracking changes made to the datasets, comparing different versions, and reverting to previous versions if necessary. It also enables collaboration among multiple users, as each user can work on their own branch and merge their changes into the main dataset when they are ready. This helps to ensure that the datasets are up-to-date, accurate, and consistent, which is important for reproducibility and transparency in research. Explanation: The text does not provide specific information about how different versions of datasets are managed. However, the general concept of version control is relevant to the management of datasets. Version control is a system for tracking changes made to files or groups of files, such as datasets. It allows users to create different versions of a dataset, compare the differences between versions, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Version control is commonly used in software development, but it is also useful for managing datasets in research.

8_29,8,29,What annotations or labels are associated with the data?,"The data is annotated with bounding boxes for six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. Introduction Herbarium specimens are an invaluable resource for research in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. With the increasing digitisation of herbarium collections, the amount of available data is growing rapidly. However, the information contained in these images is not easily accessible and requires manual annotation. The presence of certain plant organs on herbarium sheets is useful information in various scientific contexts, such as taxonomy, evolution, ecology, and conservation. Automatic recognition of these organs will help mobilise such information. In this study, we use deep learning to detect plant organs on digitised herbarium specimens. We use Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) to detect and localise six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots. We manually annotated hundreds of herbarium scans with thousands of bounding boxes for these six types of plant organs and used them for training and evaluating the plant organ detection model. Methods ",Right,"The data is annotated with bounding boxes for six types of plant organs: leaves, flowers, fruits,
seeds, stems, and roots. The manual localisation and labelling
of plant organs from specimens encountered the following difficulties: buds, flowers and
fruits are different stages emerging in the life cycle of plant reproductive organs and, in
some cases, it was therefore difficult to find a clear distinction between these structures. In
some taxa, different plant organs were impossible to separate as these were small and
crowded, for example, in dense inflorescences with bracts and flowers or stems densely
covered by leaves. In a few cases, it was also hard to differentiate from the digital image
between roots and stolons or other stem structures. In all of these cases, we placed our
labelled boxes in a way to best characterise the respective plant organ. Sometimes, this
involved including parts of other organs and, at other times, if sufficient clearly assignable
material were available, difficult parts were left out.",1.0,"The prediction answer does not answer the question. The question asks about the annotations or labels associated with the data, but the prediction answer talks about the use of deep learning to detect plant organs on digitised herbarium specimens, the use of Faster R-CNN to detect and localise six types of plant organs, and the manual annotation of hundreds of herbarium scans with thousands of bounding boxes for these six types of plant organs.

A subset of these annotated scans was then used for training of deep learning for organ detection. After training, the model was used to predict the type and location of plant organs on the test subset. The automated detection of plant organs in our study was most successful for leaves and stems. All these images were annotated for six different types of organs.",8.0,"The prediction answer is quite accurate in explaining the use of annotations or labels in the model.

8_32,8,32,How is uncertainty or confidence in model predictions captured?,"The uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is captured through the confidence score (probability) of the predictions.

The COCO method calculates average precision (with values from 0 to 100), which is a metric that encapsulates both precision and recall of the detection, for the entire predictions and each class of organs at different levels of Intersection over Union (IoU). IoU is an evaluation metric that quantifies the overlap of the predicted bounding boxes with the ground-truth bounding boxes. The IoU score ranges from 0 to 1, the higher the overlap, the higher the IoU score. The evaluation method considers all predictions as positive that have IoU of at least 0. 5 and the average precision at this level of IoU is called AP50. Similarly, the average precision with a minimum IoU of 0. 75 is called AP75, whereas AP is the average over 10 IoU levels from 0. 5 to 0. 95 with a step size of 0. 05. The precision metrics evaluated on the predicted organs on the test subset are shown in Table 2. The COCO method also calculates the AP for each category, as shown in Table 3, along with the total bounding boxes for each category in the test subset. Explanation: The uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is captured through the confidence score (probability) of the predictions. ",Right,"The performance of the model was evaluated using the COCO evaluation metric (Lin et al. 2014), which

However, the question is about how the uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is captured, and the prediction answer does not directly answer this question.

Additionally, the organ detection model was used to predict the type and location of plant organs on an un-annotated dataset, and around 200 of these scans were annotated by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes. The predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate these scans, since the predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate. After being annotated, these scans were compared with the predictions to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model on this dataset.

organs in the majority of scans. The model was trained again on all the annotated scans earlier and tested on a different un-annotated dataset. The model performed well, based on visual inspection.

8_36,8,36,How often are model weights updated by retraining with new data?,"The model weights are updated by retraining with new data every time the model is trained. In this study, the model was trained on the MNHN Paris Herbarium dataset and then retrained on the Herbarium Senckenbergianum dataset. The model weights were updated during the retraining process with the new data from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum dataset. ",Right,"The model was
trained twice, once with a training subset of 498 images on a single GPU for 9000
iterations and performance evaluated on the test subset of 155 images, also on a single
GPU and then trained again on all 653 annotated images on three GPUs for 18000
iterations for predicting plant organs on another un-annotated independent dataset to
evaluate our method. This dataset consists of 708 full scale herbarium scans, with an
average size of ca. 9600 by 6500 pixels, from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR)
(Otte et al. 2011) with a different set of species (Fig. 2) and geographical origins, which is
also available at GBIF (Senckenberg 2020).",8.0,"The prediction answer is mostly correct, but it does not specify the number of times the model was retrained.

8_38,8,38,How is bias in the data addressed?,"The bias in the data is addressed by acknowledging the inherent biases in the study and the datasets used. The training and test datasets from MNHN Paris Herbarium are from the same collection, while the Herbarium Senckenbergianum specimens are from an independent collection with different geographical and taxonomic focus, but still with a number of higher taxa in common with MNHN Paris Herbarium. The different datasets overlap mainly on the family level, partly on genus level and only slightly between the MNHN Paris Herbarium training and test datasets at species level. Therefore, it can be excluded that organ recognition is based upon species-specific features. As in nature itself and the collections represented here, families are not represented equally. Likewise, the number of labelled organs, represented in the dataset, is far from balanced and biased both by the natural distribution of these organs in the sampled taxa and by the selection of material by the collectors. Roots, for example, are mainly represented in Asteraceae and Orchidaceae, and the number of labelled organs is biased towards leaves and stems. The model was trained again on all the annotated scans and tested on a different un-annotated dataset. The model performed well, based on visual inspection. In order to evaluate the performance of the model with an average precision metric, around 200 of these scans were annotated by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes. The predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate these scans, since the predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate. After being annotated, these scans were compared with the predictions to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model on this dataset. ",Right,"We consider our study as a 'real-life' pioneer study with inherent biases. The training and
test datasets from MNHN Paris Herbarium are from the same collection, while the
Herbarium Senckenbergianum specimens are from an independent collection with different
geographical and taxonomic focus, but still with a number of higher taxa in common with
MNHN Paris Herbarium. The different datasets overlap mainly on the family level, partly on
genus level and only slightly between the MNHN Paris Herbarium training and test
datasets at species level (Fig. 2, Suppl. material 2). Therefore, we can exclude organ
recognition being based upon species-specific features. As in nature itself and the
collections represented here, families are not represented equally. Likewise, the number of
labelled organs, represented in our dataset, is far from balanced and biased both by the
natural distribution of these organs in the sampled taxa and by the selection of material by
the collectors. Roots, for example, are mainly represented in Asteraceae and Orchidaceae, families with many small and herbaceous species (Fig. 4, Suppl. material 3). In order to
better understand the difference in average precision of organ detection across different
taxa, further studies are necessary.",9.0,"The prediction answer addresses the bias in the data by acknowledging the inherent biases in the study and the datasets used. It also explains the different datasets used and their overlap, and how this overlap is used to exclude organ recognition based on species-specific features. The prediction answer also explains how the number of labelled organs is biased both by the natural distribution of these organs in the sampled taxa and by the selection of material by the collectors. It also explains how the model was trained again on all the annotated scans and tested on a different un-annotated dataset, and how the model performed well based on visual inspection. The prediction answer also explains how the model was evaluated with an average precision metric by annotating around 200 of these scans by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes. The only reason I didn't give a perfect score is because the prediction answer doesn't explicitly state that the bias in the data is addressed by using different datasets with overlap on different levels, but it is implied.",Right
