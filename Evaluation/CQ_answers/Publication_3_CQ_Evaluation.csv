3_1,3,1,What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline?,"The deep learning pipeline typically involves the use of various data formats, including: 1. Raw data: This is the initial data format, which can be in various forms such as images, audio files, text files, etc. 2. Preprocessed data: This is the data format obtained after preprocessing the raw data. Preprocessing can involve various steps such as data cleaning, data augmentation, normalization, etc. 3. Training data: This is the data format used to train the deep learning model. It is typically a subset of the preprocessed data, and is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values. 4. Validation data: This is the data format used to validate the deep learning model during the training process. It is a subset of the preprocessed data that is separate from the training data, and is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 5. Test data: This is the data format used to evaluate the final performance of the deep learning model. It is a subset of the preprocessed data that is separate from the training and validation data, and is used to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. 6. Model data: This is the data format used to store the trained deep learning model. It typically includes the model's architecture, weights, and other parameters that have been learned during the training process. 7. Prediction data: This is the data format used to make predictions using the trained deep learning model. It can be in various forms such as images, audio files, text files, etc. , and is used as input to the model to generate predictions.

Challenge 2 We used the trained model to identify species not in the reference library. The overall correct identification rate was 50. 0%. The model identified 11 of 22 species correctly, and misidentified 11 species. The model was able to identify 50% of the species not in the reference library, which is a promising result. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. The overall correct identification rate was 88. 2%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 20, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species P. isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rates, respectively. Challenge 4 We used distributional data (Brown et al. 2015b; Diesmos et al. 2015) to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co- distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. The overall correct identification rate was 92. 5%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 13, species. Discussion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely-related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate-recognition cues (mating calls). We used TensorFlow to distinguish among 20 species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis, with an overall correct identification rate of 94. 3%. We also used TensorFlow to identify species not in the reference library, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 50. We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species, and achieved an overall correct identification rate of 88.

Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 651 The results of our study are promising, but there are some limitations. First, the number of call notes (input spectrograms) available for each species was limited. To address this, future studies should access more recordings per species, particularly those represented now by recordings of few individuals. Second, model validation was a challenge. We would have been more satisfied with our evaluation if we had more recordings from numerous individuals to utilize k-fold cross-validation (Kohavi 1995) instead of leave-one-out approaches, because the former offers greater independence between calibration and evaluation datasets. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technology for taxonomic identification of closely- related species of frogs, using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls).

J Sci 22:515–557 However, one major challenge was the number of call notes (input spectrograms) avail- able for each species. Despite this limitation, our study is a novel use of a deep-learning platform to distinguish between closely- related species of frogs using simple, single-note, two-dimensional depictions of primary mate- recognition cues (mating calls). A second challenge, also related to sample size, was model validation. Taxonomic identification In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning technology for reliably identi- fying—and distinguishing among—closely-related species of frogs, as exemplified by single- note call segments (Fig. 1). Given known phylogenetic relationships (Brown et al. 2015b), we were surprised that multiple closely-related species pairs were distinguished from one another perfectly (100% success). For example, species pairs P. indeprensus and P. mim- ulus (both members of the subgenus Lupacolus), P. hazelae and P. montanus (subgenus Tirahanulap), and P. levigatus and P. insulatus (subgenus Lahatnanguri) could each be predicted, by virtue of their close phylogenetic relationships, to have similar spectral (fre- quency-related) and temporal (time- related) call properties—which they do (Fig. Still, with only a single isolated note per species, TensorFlow is able to distinguish them and correctly classify species’ identity, when presented with a large sample of positively identi- fied individual notes (i. e. , known populations of confidently-identified species, based on fully documented voucher specimens deposited in biodiversity repositories). Biodiversity and Conservation (2021) 30:643–657 649 found on those islands. Finally, we calculated the overall correct identification rate across 15 islands to compare with that based on the full reference library. Results We calibrated models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows: Challenge 1 We created a confusion matrix to depict TensorFlow’s initial results with 20 species (Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely- related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct Fig. 3 Confusion matrix for 20 currently recognized species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis (Brown et al. 2015b), using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique.

We explored different numbers of training steps and compared
results to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. Given our limited number of images per species (n = 20), we increased the validation

The study also compares certainty rates associated with species present in the reference library to species new to the library to further explain model predictions. ,Right,"To improve bioacoustic monitoring and to automate rapid candidate species discovery,
we explored CNN Inception v3 as a means to automate several key inferential tasks. We
successfully identified Platymantis species with an impressive overall identification rate
(94.3%) based on single call note characteristics, a surprising result for field biologists
(RMB and colleagues) who are accustomed to discovering and describing Platymantis spe-
cies based on temporal patterns of note repetition, complex call elements, and rich spectral
properties of many calls (Brown and Gonzalez 2007; Brown et al. 2015b; Siler et al. 2007,
2010). Incorporating distributional data (grouping species by Pleistocene island bank-
based faunal regions) allowed us to create realistic subsets of species pools. By referencing
relevant, naturally-occurring species pools, we further increased overall identification rates
to 98.7%. In addition, our model was able to flag species new to the reference library, indi-
cating potential to recognize novel species in the field. This suggests that our model could
provide a powerful framework for automated species identification and new species discov-
ery in hard-to-access regions, as well as those with high rates of undiscovered biodiversity."

We generated 20 spectrograms per species for this new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms, to be subjected to
identification using the CNN developed in Challenge 1. We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species (one species in the new dataset was already present in reference library, owing to a recent taxonomic change; Brown et al. 2015b). Then, we followed the same procedure as in Challenge 1, to test performance on a reference library that is twice as large as the original (i.e., 41 classes). These updates to the dataset are mentioned, but the specifics of how these updates were documented are not provided in the text."
3_29,3,29,What annotations or labels are associated with the data?,"The data is labeled with the species of the frog that is vocalizing. Challenge 2 We used the same CNN model from Challenge 1 to classify 22 species, 19 of which were not in the reference library. We generated 20 spectrograms per species, resulting in 440 spectrograms. The overall correct identification rate was 64. 1%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 15, species. The lowest identification rates were for Platymantis sp. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, with 0% correct identification rate. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. We followed the same procedure as in Challenge 1, to test performance on a reference library that is twice as large as the original (i. e. , 41 classes). The overall correct identification rate was 94. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 10, and 90% or above for 17, species. Challenge 4 We used distributional data (Brown et al. 2015b; Diesmos et al. 2015) to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). First, we grouped the 41 species (20 described species, plus 21 undescribed candidate species) based on Philippine islands they inhabit, resulting in 15 subsets of co-occurring species in “communities” of 3 to 27 species (Fig. 2). Then, we trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. We calculated the overall correct identification rate for each subset. The overall correct identification rate was 98. 7%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 13, and 90% or above for 15, subsets. The lowest identification rates were for subsets from Luzon, Mindanao, and Panay, with 94. 6, 95. 0, and 95. 0% correct identification rate, respectively. Conclusion We used TensorFlow to classify 20 species of Philippine forest frogs, genus Platymantis, using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. 3%. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rate, respectively. We also used TensorFlow to classify 22 species, 19 of which were not in the reference library. We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. We used distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. ",Right,"we used TensorFlow Inception v3 to design a robust, automated species identification system for 41 Philippine frog species (genus Platymantis), utilizing single-note audio spectrograms."
3_30,3,30,How are these annotations or labels used in the model?,"In the model, the annotations or labels are used to train the model to recognize and classify the different species of frogs. Each spectrogram image is associated with a label indicating the species of frog that it represents. During training, the model learns to associate the visual patterns in the spectrogram images with the corresponding labels. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the species of frog for new, unlabeled spectrogram images. ",Right,"we used TensorFlow Inception v3 to design a robust, automated species identification system for 41 Philippine frog species (genus Platymantis), utilizing single-note audio spectrograms."
3_31,3,31,What predictions or classifications are generated by the deep learning model?,"The deep learning model generates predictions or classifications of Platymantis species based on frequency distributions of individual call notes of each species. It is trained on single-note spectrograms and is capable of identifying Platymantis species with an impressive overall identification rate of 94. 3%. When incorporating distributional data and referencing relevant, naturally-occurring species pools, the overall identification rate increases to 98. 7%. The model is also able to flag species new to the reference library, indicating potential to recognize novel species in the field. ",Right,"TensorFlow identified species with a ~ 94% overall correct identification rate.
Incorporating distributional data increased the overall identification rate to ~ 99%. In applying TensorFlow to a dataset that included undescribed species in addition to known species, our model was able to differentiate undescribed species through variation in “cer-
tainty” rate; the overall certainty rate for undescribed species was 65.5% versus 83.6% for described species. This indicates that, in addition to discriminating recognized frog species, our model has the potential to flag possible new species."
3_32,3,32,How is uncertainty or confidence in model predictions captured?,"Uncertainty or confidence in model predictions is captured by TensorFlow through the use of certainty rates. Certainty rates are a measure of how confident the model is in its predictions. In the study, the certainty rate is used as a factor to evaluate the performance of the model on test images. The higher the certainty rate, the more confident the model is in its prediction. ",Partial,"TensorFlow provides each image identification task with two elements/features: suggested
species names and a certainty rate. Certainty rate can be a factor by which to evaluate classifier performance on test images as well. After applying TensorFlow on a testing dataset
consisting of 22 species, we considered two factors to evaluate model performance: (1) number of images per class assigned to a species present in reference library, and (2) aver-
age certainty rate associated with those identifications (Fig. 4). Among the 22 species in the test dataset, only one, P. isarog, was also present in the reference library; however, the
remainder were new to the training set. As a result, it was impossible for TensorFlow to provide a correct answer for the other 21 species. The overall certainty rate for those 21
species was 65.5%. However, in Challenge 1, the overall certainty rate for the 20 species present in reference library was 83.6%. A Mann–Whitney U test (Python 3.8.2) comparing
certainty rates associated with species present in the reference library (n = 20) to species new to the library (n = 21) indicated that TensorFlow yielded a significantly lower certainty
rate for the latter group (U = 56379.5, P = 1.09e–19)."
3_33,3,33,Are there post-processing steps applied to the model's output?,"Yes, there are post-processing steps applied to the model's output. The post-processing steps include the use of a threshold to determine whether the model's output is a positive or negative identification. The threshold is set at 0. 5, meaning that if the model's output is greater than or equal to 0. 5, it is considered a positive identification, and if it is less than 0. 5, it is considered a negative identification. Additionally, the model's output is rounded to the nearest integer to ensure a clear positive or negative identification. ",Wrong,The text does not provide information about the post-processing steps applied to the model's output.

Linux environment (Ubuntu, version 18.04; https​://www.ubunt​u.com), to explore the challenge of automating frog species identification. The text does not provide about the information on the hardware used for model deployment."
3_36,3,36,How often are model weights updated by retraining with new data?,"The model weights are updated every time the model is retrained with new data. Challenge 3 We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 19, and 90% or above for 30, species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct classification, respectively. The overall correct identification rate was 92. 7%. Challenge 4 We used distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). We trained and tested the classifier employing the set of samples from the species in each subset. We achieved 100% correct identification rate for 13, and 90% or above for 14, subsets. The lowest identification rates were for subsets of species from the islands of Luzon and Mindoro, with 80% correct classification. The overall correct identification rate was 95. 3%. Discussion We demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning technology for reliably identifying and distinguishing among closely-related frog species, as exemplified by single-note call segments. We used TensorFlow to classify 20 species of Platymantis, and achieved 94. 3% correct identification rate. We also achieved 100% correct identification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. We did not detect any systematic errors in TensorFlow classification, such as repeatedly confusing one species with another. We also tested TensorFlow to identify species not in the reference library. The lowest identification rates were for closely- related species Platymantis isarog and P. We also tested TensorFlow to identify all 41 species for which recordings are available. Our results demonstrate that TensorFlow can be used to identify species of Platymantis based on single-note spectrograms. This is important because single-note spectrograms are the most common type of data available for many species of frogs. Our results also demonstrate that TensorFlow can be used to identify species of Platymantis based on single-note spectrograms from species not in the reference library. This is important because new species of Platymantis are being discovered regularly, and it is important to be able to identify these species based on single-note spectrograms. Our results also demonstrate that TensorFlow can be used to identify all 41 species of Platymantis for which recordings are available. This is important because it demonstrates that TensorFlow can be used to identify all species of Platymantis, not just the 20 species used in the initial training. Our results also demonstrate that TensorFlow can be used to identify all 41",Right,"We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by add-
ing 21 new, undescribed species (one species in the new dataset was already present

3_37,3,37,What ethical considerations are taken into account during development and deployment?,"The ethical considerations taken into account during development and deployment of the automated species identification system include the potential for misidentification, the impact on the privacy of individuals, and the potential for misuse of the technology. The developers ensured that the system was tested extensively to minimize the risk of misidentification, and that the data used to train the system was anonymized to protect the privacy of individuals. Additionally, the developers considered the potential for misuse of the technology and implemented measures to prevent unauthorized access and use. ",Wrong,"The text does not provide information about the ethical considerations taken into account during

3_38,3,38,How is bias in the data addressed?,"The bias in the data is addressed by using distributional data to create subsets of species, with the goal of generating separate classification tasks with lower numbers of classes (species) per task (local species pools, reflecting documented patterns of co-distributed species from the archipelago’s faunal regions). This helps to reduce bias by limiting the possible universe of a species’ identification to the biogeographically-relevant species pools.
