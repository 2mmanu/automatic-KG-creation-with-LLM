7_1,7,1,What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline?,"The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that square patches were extracted with the labelled pixel at their centre and there is no restriction on the size of these patches. It can be inferred that the data format used for these patches is likely to be image files such as JPEG or PNG. Additionally, the classiﬁcation process uses a 2-layered neural network, which typically takes ﬂat arrays of numerical data as input. Therefore, it can be inferred that the image patches are likely to be converted into ﬂat arrays of numerical data before being fed into the neural network. ",Right,"In this paper, we propose a computer vision and deep
learning based framework for the automatic annotation of
unlabelled coral images. Each training image has 50 pixels
marked with corresponding ground truth labels. State-of-art
deep learning architectures take an input image of ﬁxed size
and hence image or patch ground truth labels are required. To
overcome this bottleneck, square patches were extracted with
the labelled pixel at their centre. There is no restriction on the
size of these patches. Instead of using the whole image for
training, we extracted patches at multiple scales centred around
the given labelled pixels."
7_2,7,2,What are the sources of input data for the deep learning pipeline?,The input data for the deep learning pipeline comes from unlabelled coral mosaics of three sites of the Abrolhos Islands coral reef from two years. ,Right,"With the trained coral classiﬁers,
we analyse the coral reefs of the Abrolhos Islands which form
one of Western Australia’s unique marine areas. We analyse
unlabelled coral mosaics of three sites of this coral reef from
two years."
7_3,7,3,How was raw data collected in terms of methods and tools?,"The raw data was collected using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with a high- resolution camera. The AUV was used to capture images of the coral reefs in the Abrolhos Islands. The images were then used to generate mosaics and coral maps, which were used to quantify the coral population and analyze the trends in coral population. ",Right,"This Australian benthic data set (Benthoz15) [23] consists
of an expert-annotated set of georeferenced benthic images and
associated sensor data, captured by an autonomous underwater
vehicle (AUV) around Australia."

7_5,7,5,What preprocessing steps are involved before training the deep learning model?,"The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that square patches were extracted with the labelled pixel at their centre, and there is no restriction on the size of these patches. Instead of using the whole image for training, patches at multiple scales centred around the given labelled pixels were extracted. This technique is termed as spatial pyramid pooling (SPP). Therefore, it can be inferred that some form of patch extraction and resizing is involved in the preprocessing step. ",Wrong,"We applied color channel stretch on each image in the
dataset. We calculated the 1% and 99% intensity percentiles
for each color channel. The lower intensity was subtracted
from all the intensities in each respective channel and the
negative values were set to zero. These intensities were then
divided by the upper percentile. The resulting intensities
achieved a better performance compared to the original ones."

This resulted in better performance compared to the original intensities. ",Right,"We applied color channel stretch on each image in the

7_8,7,8,What is the architecture of the deep learning model in the pipeline?,The architecture of the deep learning model in the pipeline is a 2-layered neural network used to classify corals from non-corals. The model uses features learned using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) technique for patch extraction. The SPP technique makes the resulting features scale invariant. ,Right,"In this paper, we propose a computer vision and deep
learning based framework for the automatic annotation of
unlabelled coral images. This framework is based on a novel
coral classiﬁcation algorithm, which employs the powerful
image representations of CNNs. Instead of using the whole image for
training, we extracted patches at multiple scales centred around
the given labelled pixels. We achieved higher classiﬁcation
accuracy when multi-scale patches were used instead of just
one ﬁxed size. This technique is termed as spatial pyramid
pooling (SPP) [16]. This patch extraction method makes the
resulting features scale invariant. A 2-layered neural network
was then used to classify corals from non-corals."

The framework detected the decreasing trend in the coral population of this region as well. ,Right,"These
images are used to train a deep network which then classiﬁes
unlabelled images and mosaics. Marine experts are included
in this pipeline to give feedback on the classiﬁcation accuracy.
The best performing classiﬁer is then used to generate coral
maps from the mosaics of the Abrolhos Islands.We achieved a
classiﬁcation accuracy greater than 90% in all of our experiments. The best performance is achieved when the training and
testing sets contain images from the same year."
