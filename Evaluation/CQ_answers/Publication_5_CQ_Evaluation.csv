5_1,5,1,What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline?,"The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include multitemporal remote sensing data, such as MODIS-derived NDVI and LAI images collected in 2009, and plant species richness data from South Korea. The remote sensing data are co-registered and resampled to 30-arcseconds from 15-arcseconds of the original sources. The plant species richness data from South Korea are used to estimate potential plant species richness patterns for North Korea using a state-of-the-art DL approach. ",Right,"we estimated plant species richness in South Korea by combining the 1574 species’ suitability estimations from species distribution models at a resolution of 30-arcseconds. We then developed a DL-based species richness model using the species richness results from South Korea and a time-series of MODIS-driven NDVI and LAI, which were resampled to 30-arcseconds from 15-arcseconds of the original sources."

5_3,5,3,How was raw data collected in terms of methods and tools?,"The raw data for this study was collected using remote sensing data and plant species occurrence records. The remote sensing data was collected using multitemporal Landsat 8 images, which were preprocessed using the Google Earth Engine platform. The plant species occurrence records were collected from the Korea National Arboretum, the National Institute of Biological Resources, and the Korea Forest Service. These records were used to estimate the potential plant species richness for the Korean Peninsula, including North Korea, which has limited survey data.

The study used remote sensing",Partial,"To estimate species richness in South Korea, we used 183,854 occurrence records of
vascular plants, comprising 1574 species from South Korea’s Third National Ecosystem
Survey data (National Ecosystem Survey data are available at http://ecobank.nie.re.kr
(accessed on 24 June 2021)). Most species observations were recorded between 2006 and
2012. Evaluating the habitat suitability for all species located in South Korea would be
ideal for determining the potential species richness, but we required a minimum number
of 10 occurrence records for use in modeling, since small sample sizes affect the reliability
of statistical analyses [36,37]. The observation records for the 1574 species ranged from 10
to 921. We downloaded 19 bioclimatic variables at a grid resolution of 30-arcseconds (≈900

most practical and typical type of feedforward neural network and is effective for solving
regression problems [62]. However, MLP is now deemed insufficient for modern advanced

5_6,5,6,Are there transformations or augmentations applied to the input data?,The provided context does not mention any transformations or augmentations applied to the input data. ,Wrong,"In this study, we used the 16-day composite NDVI product (MOD13A1 and MYD13A1)
at a resolution of 15 arcseconds and a combined 8-day composite LAI product (MCD15A2)
at 15 arcseconds. However, since the MCD15A2 data contain many missing values because
of high cloud cover, and to match the temporal resolution of the NDVI product, we
converted them to 16-day composite images. To be consistent with the species richness
results in South Korea, these NDVI and LAI data were then resampled at a spatial resolution
of 30 arcseconds. The data were downloaded from the Land Processes Distributed Active
Archive Center (LP DAAC; https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/ (accessed on 24 June 2021)) and
processed using the MODIS Reprojection Tool to convert the map projection and to create
mosaic images. To cover the entire Korean Peninsula, 3 images (h27v04, h27v05, and
h28v05 of MODIS’s Sinusoidal Tile Grid) were composited."
5_7,5,7,Does the paper discuss data bias or ethical implications?,"No, the paper does not discuss data bias or ethical implications. ",Wrong,"The bias (mean difference between PSRS-SDMs and
PSRDL) was calculated as 10.21, indicating that the proposed model slightly underestimated
the potential plant species richness compared with the reference S-SDMs species richness,
but the differences were small and may be handled by adjusting the slope and offset
parameters in post-processing if necessary. A remarkable Pearson’s correlation coefficient
(0.98) was achieved."

5_9,5,9,How was the model selected for a specific task?,"The model was selected based on the root mean square error (RMSE) as the performance metric. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance decreased with random shuffling. The feature with the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals was determined using a statistical feature importance test (SFIT). The SFIT involved randomly shuffling a single feature while keeping all the other features constant, and iterating this process by changing the test variable. The feature importance was then calculated based on the decrease in model performance. ",Right,"Due to the unique characteristics of neural networks, which solve problems by ex-
ploiting the hidden relationships inherent in multiple input variables, it was difficult to
physically quantify the importance of the input variables. As an alternative, we performed
a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to explain which feature had the greatest sig-
nificance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in
an operational retrieval system. For the SFIT, a single feature was randomly shuffled,
while all the other features were kept constant. We iterated this process by changing the
test variable. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance
decreased with random shuffling. In this study, we used the root mean square error (RMSE)
as the performance metric."
5_10,5,10,What were the considerations in the model selection process?,"The model selection process considered the use of macro-ecological models and stacking species distribution models (S-SDMs) to estimate species richness. The S-SDMs approach was chosen because it combines the predictions of each species’ SDM to estimate species richness, and probability-based stacking produced unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness. The model was then validated using independent tree plot datasets from the Korea Forest Service. ",Right,"Several modeling approaches, including macro-ecological models [50] and stacking
species distribution models (S-SDMs) [51], have been proposed for estimating species
richness. As many global species databases, such as the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), eBird (https://ebird.org (accessed
on 24 June 2021) [52]), and iNaturalist (www.inaturalist.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)),
provide species’ occurrence data [14,16], S-SDMs which combine the predictions of each
species’ SDM to estimate species richness have become a common strategy in recent
studies [53]. Although there is still no agreement as to how to stack each species’ predictions,
many studies have found that probability-based (raw SDM results ranging from 0 to 1)
stacking produced unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness."
5_11,5,11,How many models are used in the pipeline?,The pipeline uses two models: a deep learning (DL) model and a species distribution model (SDM). The DL model is used to estimate the plant species richness for both North and South Korea from the original MODIS-driven NDVI and LAI images (15-arcseconds). The SDM model is used to estimate the potential plant species richness of South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of the 1574 species. ,Right,"we evaluated our two model results, S-SDMs and DL species richness, by
comparing the species richness obtained from independent tree plot datasets from the
Korea Forest Service. We estimated the potential plant species richness of South Korea by combining the
probability-based SDM results of the 1574 species."

The study uses Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Deep Learning models, which are commonly used methods in species distribution modeling. However, the study does not mention any specific innovations or improvements in these methods that would make them state-of-the-art. ",Partial,"Studies that have investigated combinations of remote sensing and machine learning ap-
proaches to represent biodiversity include Lopatin et al. [29], who modeled vascular plant
species richness for trees, shrubs, and herbs using 12 airborne LiDAR-derived variables.
They compared the suitability of random forest (RF) and a generalized linear model (GLM),
and found that the GLM had better performance."
5_13,5,13,How is the model initialized?,The model is initialized by using the first 10% of the data for training and the remaining 90% for testing. This is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new data. ,Wrong,"The output layer (y) is a value of species richness
derived from S-SDMs. At each pixel location where no missing values existed, we obtained
approximately 500,000 samples of x and y in South Korea for model training and testing. To develop a geographically more robust estimation model due to the lack of survey
data in North Korea, stacked species richness training data for South Korea were divided
into quadrants (NE, NW, SE, and SW). For each quadrant of South Korea, we developed 4
MLPs using 3 subsets as the training set and the other set as the testing set."

activation function because of its promising performance in the literature [65]. Dropout
layers with a rate of 0.2 were added to each hidden layer to prevent model overfitting [66].

5_38,5,38,How is bias in the data addressed?,"The authors address bias in the data by using probability-based stacking, which has been found to produce unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness. This method combines the predictions of each species' species distribution model (SDM) to estimate species richness. The authors also use MODIS products, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI), as input variables to estimate the potential plant species richness of South Korea. These products are known to have high temporal and spatial resolution, making them suitable for monitoring vegetation dynamics and estimating species richness. However, the authors do not explicitly mention how they address bias in the MODIS products. ",Right,"Although there is still no agreement as to how to stack each species’ predictions, many studies have found that probability-based (raw SDM results ranging from 0 to 1) stacking produced unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness [16,50,53,54]. We estimated the potential plant species richness of South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of the 1574 species."
5_39,5,39,Is there transparency in the decision-making process regarding bias?,"The provided context does not directly address the query about transparency in the decision-making process regarding bias. However, it does mention that the study used a method called ""stacking species distribution models"" to estimate species richness. This method combines the predictions of each species' distribution model to estimate species richness. While the study does not explicitly discuss transparency in the decision-making process regarding bias, it does mention that probability-based stacking produced unbiased richness that is closer to the true species richness. This suggests that the study took steps to minimize bias in the estimation of species richness. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine whether the decision-making process regarding bias was transparent.
