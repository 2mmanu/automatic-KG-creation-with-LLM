%INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the concepts and relations (properties) and build an ontology in RDF format for describing the provenance of DL pipeline. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Don't provide anything other than the ontology in RDF format.        

Use the IRI for the base ontology: https://w3id.org/dlprov/. Use the ontology classes and relations as the base ontology. 
Below are the examples and follow the same format for all the questions:
  
Concepts: Hyperparameter, Model
Relations: hasHyperparameter, hasModel
